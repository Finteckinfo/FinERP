RESPONSES TO COMMON QUESTIONS

Q: Is this production ready?
A: Yes, for testnet testing. For mainnet, we recommend an external security audit (2-3 weeks) before launch.

Q: Will this work on my computer?
A: Yes, if you have Node.js v20 or higher. We provide step-by-step instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Q: How do I know it's secure?
A: We've completed Slither analysis, TypeScript strict mode, ESLint checks, npm audit, and manual security review. See SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md.

Q: Can I test on real money?
A: Not yet. Testing is on local blockchain and Sepolia testnet (fake money). Mainnet deployment comes after feedback and external audit.

Q: What if I find a bug?
A: Report it in GitHub issues. We'll fix it and deploy an update.

Q: How do I run this?
A: Follow SETUP_FOR_BEGINNERS.md. Takes about 45 minutes.

Q: What is the Telegram bot?
A: Bot sends real-time notifications when projects are created or tasks are updated. It also provides a Mini App interface.

Q: What is Account Abstraction?
A: Advanced feature for gasless transactions. Users pay gas with FIN tokens instead of ETH. See GASLESS_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md.

Q: Can I deploy this myself?
A: Yes. See PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for step-by-step instructions.

Q: How do I get test ETH?
A: From faucet.alchemy.com or sepoliafaucet.com (free, just need a wallet).

Q: What happens if there is an error?
A: SETUP_FOR_BEGINNERS.md has a troubleshooting section. Most errors have simple solutions.
