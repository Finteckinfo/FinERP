## 💡 How It Works

### The Workflow

```
1. Project Owner → Creates project → Funds held in escrow
                       ↓
2. Break down work → Create subtasks → Allocate funds
                       ↓
3. Assign tasks → Team members work → Submit for review
                       ↓
4. Owner reviews → Approve/Reject → Funds released/held
```

### Security Model

- **Smart Contract Escrow**: Funds locked in blockchain smart contract
- **No Middleman**: Direct peer-to-peer transactions
- **Transparent**: All transactions verifiable on-chain
- **Immutable**: Contract logic cannot be changed
- **Wallet-Based Auth**: Cryptographic security built-in
